Getting to Know the Data(Step 1)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Using pandas, read in each of the four CSV files: `game_log.csv`, `park_codes.csv`, `person_codes.csv`, `team_codes.csv`. For each:<br>
* Use methods and attributes like DataFrame.shape, DataFrame.head(), and DataFrame.tail() to explore the data.<br>
* Write a brief paragraph to describe each file, including for the helper files how the data intersects with the main log file.<br>
2. Research any fields you are not familiar with, using both the text file and Google as needed. In particular, you should explore and write a short paragraph on:<br>
* What each defensive position number represents.
* The values in the various league fields, and which leagues they represent.
